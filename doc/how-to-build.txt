1. Assemble the Y axis (part 1)

1.1 Gather the following parts

	a. The two M10 threaded rods
	b. The Y axis smooth rods
	c. The plastic Y end pieces (2)
	d. The two plastic frame brace supports
	e. 12 M10 nuts and washers
	f. Four linear bearings (LM8UU) 

1.2 Hardware Assembly

*	Slide a brace support onto each threaded rod. On each side of the 
	supports, put a washer, a nut, another nut and another washer (in 
	that order).
*	Next, slide two two Y end pieces over the ends of the threaded rods. 
	Place a washer then nut on each end.

1.3 Tightening the Y axis

*	Start at one end (either Y motor or Y idler end) and tighten the two 
	nuts against the end so that the threaded rod is flush with the outside 
	of the nut. Tighten both sides of the first end while everything else 
	is loose along the threaded rods. Use two wrenches  to tighten the nuts 
	against the end until snug (tight, but don't compress enough to deform 
	or break the plastic).
*	Place two linear bearings on each Y axis smooth rod.
*	Next, with the other Y end still loosely attached, place the two Y axis 
	smooth rods across the top and fit into the grooves along the top of 
	the ends.
*	Press down on the corners (not in the middle of the rods!) to seat the 
	rods into the Y ends.
*	Tighten one corner of the remaining end.
*	Now take a moment to measure with a ruler between the end posts of the 
	tightened side. (355mm for reference).
*	Flip the assembly around and repeat the measurement as you tighten the 
	remaining corner (tighten it just a little first, then measure. If the 
	distance is a little less than the first side, tighten the inner nut 
	outward toward the outer nut, if the distance is a little more than the 
	first side, then tighten the outer nut toward the inner one. Try to get 
	the two sides as close to the same distance as possible. This will help 
	ensure your y axis bearings don't experience any binding forces).
*	Repeat the measurement on the first side and check that all corners are 
	nice and snug. Take your time on this step, it may require a couple 
	iterations to get the axis square. 

1.4 Prep the Print Bed

While the Y axis assembly is free, it is a good time to prepare the print 
bed which you will attach later.

Gather the following materials

	a.	The Y axis assembly you just completed
	b.	The wood print bed support
	c.	The heat bed
	d.	The four linear bearing holders
	e.	Eight miniature zip ties 


*	Place the heat bed circuitboard over the wood bed and mark the four 
	corner locations with a pencil.
*	Put the heat bed circuitboard aside and place the four linear bearing 
	holders over the linear bearings along the Y axis rods.
*	Turn the Y axis assembly over so that the smooth rods (and bearing 
	holders) are against the wood print bed surface.
*	Align the front edge of the two bearing holders nearest the Y end idler 
	with a line that is 80mm from the front edge of the bed.
*	Align the back edge of the two bearing holders nearest the Y end motor 
	mount with a line that is approx 10mm from the back edge of the bed.
*	Mark all the holes for the bearing holders with a pencil.
*	Remove the wood print bed and drill all the holes you marked with a 5mm 
	drill bit. (You want the holes a little over-sized so that there is 
	some room for the screws to "float" when you attach the bed).
*	Attach the linear bearing holders to the Y axis linear bearings with 
	zip ties.

Set the prepared wood print bed aside.

2. Assemble the Frame (part 1)

2.1 Gather the following parts

	a.	The two side pieces of 2020 aluminum extrusion (the longer ones, 
		generally)
	b.	One of the two horizontal pieces of 2020 aluminum extrusion (the 
		shorter ones, generally)
	c.	22 T-slot nuts
	d.	14 M5 x 8mm screws
	e.	The plastic Z motor holders (2)
	f.	The plastic rear frame brackets (2) 

2.2 Hardware Assembly 

*	Slide 6 T-nuts into one side of the shorter extrusion (this wlll be the 
	bottom piece of the frame).
*	Turn the extrusion over (being careful not to let the nuts slide out 
	that you just put in) and slide 8 more nuts into the opposite side that 
	you begain with.
*	Place the two remaining extrusions to the sides of the first, and slide 
	two T nuts into each on the side facing up.
*	Get the two corner braces and place one over each corner. Line up the 
	two nuts on each extrusion and attach the braces with a total of 8 M5 
	screws. Note that the longer extrusions (the "sides" of the frame) 
	should cover the ends of the bottom extrusion piece. Leave the screws 
	loose until all 8 are started. Stand the frame "upright" to ensure the 
	sides are slid down flush with the bottom and alternately tighten until 
	all the screws are tight.
*	Rotate the frame so the other side is facing you and put it back flat 
	on your work surface.
*	Slide two more T nuts into each side piece and attach the motor mounts 
	the same way you did the rear brackets, using 6 more M5 screws.
*	You should have four T nuts sliding around between the lower corners, 
	which will be used to attach the Y axis to the frame in the next step.

3. Mount the Y axis to the frame

3.1 The following parts are used during this step: 

	a.	The partially-assembled Y axis from step 1. 
	b.	The partially assembled frame from step 2. 
	c.	Eight M5 x 8mm screws 	

3.2 Mounting the Y axis

*	Place the Y axis over the frame so that the Y motor end is toward the 
	rear, and the Z motor brackets are toward the front. 	
*	Slide the Y axis along the threaded rods so that there is ** 135mm **
	from the Y motor end and the frame braces 	
*	Tighten the nuts on the first side finger-tight against the frame brace 
	then turn the assembly around and repeat on the other side. Measure a 
	couple times to make sure the distance from the y motor end to the frame 
	braces is the same on each corner. Next slide the Y axis assembly left 
	or right along the lower frame extrusion so that there is ** 50mm ** 
	from the upright extrusion to the inner edge of the frame brace on the 
	"left" side of the printer (as viewed with the Y axis idler toward you). 	
*	Tighten the frame braces using 8 M5 screws into the T slot nuts that 
	are alread in the lower frame extrusion. Finish tightening the nuts of 
	the threaded rod against the braces, double-checking that the distance 
	from the Y end to the braces is the same on each side. A convenient 
	place to measure this after the nuts are snug is from the inside of the 
	nuts (approx 116mm). 	

4. Assemble the X axis (part 1)

4.1 Gather the following parts: 

	a.	The two plastic X end pieces ("motor" and "idler") 
	b.	Eight linear bearings (LM8UU) 
	c.	The two X axis smooth rods 
	d.	Two M5 nuts 	

4.2 Hardware Assembly

*	Press two linear bearings into each X end. 
*	Using pliers, gently press an M5 nut into the provided insert in each 
	end. 
*	Place two linear bearings on each of the smooth rods. 
*	Press each X end onto the pair of smooth rods, being sure to orient 
	them so that the M5 nuts are on the same side of the rods. 	

5. Assembling the frame (part 2)

5.1 Gather the following: 

	a.	The two upper Z axis mounts. 
	b.	The remaining piece of aluminum extrusion (the top bar) 
	c.	Four t-slot nuts 
	d.	Five more t-slot nuts if you are going to use the filament holder 
		and SMART electronics mount. 
	e.	Four M5 x 8mm screws 	

5.2 

*	Insert two t-slot nuts into the top side of the aluminum extrusion. 
*	If you will be using the filament holder, rotate the extrusion 90 
	degrees and insert two more t-slot nuts into the top side. 
*	Insert the remaining t-slot nuts into the side opposite from the one 
	you started with. 

5.3 

*	Attach the upper Z axis mounts to the ends of the extrusion, tightening 
	the M5 nuts just until snug. Be sure to keep the two t slot nuts for 
	the filament holder on the "top" and the t slot nuts for the SMART 
	electronics mount and filament holder to the back (side away from the 
	rod holders).

6. Mounting the X axis to the Z axis

6.1 Gather the following

	a.	The partialy assembled frame from step 3.
	b.	The X axis assembly from step 4.
	c.	The upper frame assembly from step 5.
	d.	The remaining two smooth rods
	e.	The Z axis threaded rods (M5)
	f.	Two NEMA17 stepper motors
	g.	Eight M3 x 10mm screws (washers recommended)
	h.	Two Z axis couplers (either 5mm x 5mm couplers or 3/16" vinyl tubing)
	i.	Eight t-slot nuts
	j.	Eight M5 x 8mm screws 

6.2 Mounting the X axis onto the frame.

*	Attach the two Z axis motors to the motor mounts using four M3 x 10mm 
	screws each. Place the z axis couplers on each motor shaft.
*	Press each Z axis smooth rod firmly down into the rod holder of each motor 
	mount, being careful to keep the rods straight up and down to avoid 
	breaking the mounts.
*	Gently slide the X axis assembly down over the Z axis rods. If the linear 
	bearings in each X end do not align with the Z axis rods, remove the X 
	axis assembly and gently push/pull the two ends to get the distance right. 
	The motor end of the X axis assembly should be on your left (with the Y 
	idler end toward you).
*	Insert two t-slot nuts into both the front and back sides of each end (8 
	total). You may want to hold the frame assembly on your lap with the 
	upright extensions horizontally at the point, so that the t slot nuts 
	don't slide down to the botttom of the frame. If they do, simply place 
	your hands over the tops of the extrusions, keeping the z axis smooth 
	rods supported, and tip the assembly over to slide the nuts back toward 
	the top.
*	Place the upper frame assembly on the frame. Fit the tops of the z axis 
	smooth rods into the rod holders.
*	Secure the top of the frame using 8 M5 x 8mm screws. Be sure to press 
	the top of the frame down securely onto the vertical extrusions, and 
	then press inward on each top corner to seat the upper extrusion against 
	the sides.
*	With the X axis assembly resting at the bottom of the Z axis smooth 
	rods, thread the z axis threaded rods down through the nut in each X 
	end until the threaded rods rest against the Z axis motor shafts. 
*	Tighten the z axis couplers. 

7. Completing the Frame Assembly

7.1 Mount X and Y motors

*	In addition to the frame from the previous step, gather the following:

	a.	Two NEMA17 stepper motors
	b.	Two belt pulleys
	c.	The two idler bearings and mounts
	d.	Three M3 x 10mm screws
	e.	Three M3 x 14mm screws
	f.	Two screws with lock nuts for mounting the belt idlers (probably 
		M3 x 25mm) 

*	Mount the motors to the X and Y axis motor mounts using three screws 
	each.  
*	Fit a pulley on each motor shaft and tighten the grub screws to keep 
	them secure.
*	Snap an idler bearing into each pair of plastic bearing guides, then
	attach the idlers to the opposite ends of the X and Y axis from where
	you attached the motors.  Don't overtighten the screws that hold on
	the idlers.

7.2 Attach print bed

*	You will need:

	a.	The print bed you prepared earlier.
	b.	Eight M3 x 14mm screws and an equal number of M3 nuts and washers.

*	Mount the print bed to the Y axis bearing holders.	The washer should 
	go on the screw first, which should go downward through the wood print 
	bed and bearing holder, and secured with a nut.  Attach each screw only 
	loosely first, then check that the bed slides smoothly back and forth 
	along the Y axis. Tighten the nuts a little at a time until secure. 	

7.3 Attach the X carriage.

*	You will need:

	a.	The printed X carriage
	b.	Eight miniature zip ties 

* 	Attach the X carriage with the belt guide "up" and with the flat 
	surface (where you will attach the extruder) toward the front of the
	printer (the Y idler end).
	
8.	Attach Belts

*	You will need:

	a.	The X axis drive belt.
	b.	The Y axis drive belt.
	c.	The Y belt holder.
	d.	Two M3 x 14mm screws and nuts.
	e.	8 Miniature zip ties.

*	Thread the X axis belt into place and secure with four zip ties (two
	on each side of the extruder, trimmed short after tight).
*	Turn the printer over or have a friend hold it upside down, being 
	careful not to lift by or put pressure on the X axis rods.  
*	Thread the Y axis belt into place.  Hold the belt tight and use as a
	guide for placing the Y belt holder.  The leading edge of the belt 
	holder should be approximately in the middle of the wood print bed.
*	Mark the holes for the Y belt holder, then set the holder and belt 
	aside and drill the two holes with a 4-5mm hand drill.
